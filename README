Filter-CommaEquals version 0.01
===============================

Filter::CommaEquals adds support for ,= to any package or script.
Perl has +=, -=, /=, *=, .=, and so forth to operate on scalars,
but it doesn't have ,= to operate on arrays. This module
effectively lets you rewrite push statements with ,= instead.
